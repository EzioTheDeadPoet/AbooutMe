# Hall of Fame

## Special Message

I highly encourage you to support the [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) project before you consider supporting me, simply because most I do is related to that project and it is 100% hosted due to the support by the community. That said I will support the WJ project myself once I have a stable income and/or enough supporters to be able to.

If you want to support me here are the links for doing so:
