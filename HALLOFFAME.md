# Hall of Fame

## Special Message

I highly encourage you to support the [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) project before you consider supporting me, simply because most I do is related to that project and it is 100% hosted due to the support by the community. That said I will support the WJ project myself once I have a stable income and/or enough supporters to be able to.

If you want to support me you can buy me a drink:

## My Supporters ‚ô•

### The ones without I would probably not have started modding Skyrim

[SME(FT)](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/SME-FT-/) and [Tales from the Northern Lands](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/Tales-from-the-Northern-Lands/) where only possible because both gifted me Nexus Premium back when Wabbajack had a hard requirement for it when I could not have afforded it.
