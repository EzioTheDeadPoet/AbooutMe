## About Me

Hey you my name is Luca, you most likely will know me most likely as the creator of [SME(FT) - Skyrim Modding Essentials (Fixes & Tools)](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/SME-FT-/), [Tales from the Northern Lands](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/Tales-from-the-Northern-Lands/), [Luca's Cellshading ReShade Preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40578) or my fixes for [ASO - Artistic Skyrim Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9111) found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/42051055?tab=user+files). I help out on the Wabbajack and occasionally help with alpha tests for new features, either directly or indirectly by having created a nice test list with SME(FT). I occasionally shitpost on twitter and try to get better at doing digital art and coding in my free time.

## My Modlist

- [SME(FT) - Skyrim Modding Essentials (Fixes & Tools)](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/SME-FT-/)
  - It is all in the name it is a collection of the bare minimum of mods with the best possible compatibility in mind and all the tools ready to go for you to start modding either to create a own modded setup, or to test your freshly created mods or the mods you want to create.

- [Tales from the Northern Lands](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/Tales-from-the-Northern-Lands/)
  - This is my own modlist I made with SME(FT) as a base that is primarily focused on bringing you a visual overhaul similar to Borderlands and other cell shaded games and secondly focused to be in direct contrast to all the dark, hard or complicated modlist out there, by focusing on a player empowering progression and the addition of ~93.700 weapons and ~91.000 wearable items (Armors, jewelry and clothes) to find.
