# Luca|EzioTheDeadPoet

## About Me

Hey my name is Luca, you most likely will know me as the creator of [Tales from the Northern Lands](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/Tales-from-the-Northern-Lands/) or one of my other mods or Synthesis Patchers found on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/42051055?tab=user+files).

I also help out with the Wabbajack Project and occasionally help with alpha tests for new features, either directly or indirectly by having created a nice test list with SME(FT). I enjoy videogames and try to get better at doing digital art and coding in my free time.

## My Modlists

- ~~[SME(FT) - Skyrim Modding Essentials (Fixes & Tools)](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/SME-FT-/)~~ **Discontinued since 19.07.2022**  
*Use [Skyrim Modding Essentials by Phoenix](https://thephoenixflavour.com/sme/) instead.*

- [Tales from the Northern Lands](https://eziothedeadpoet.github.io/Tales-from-the-Northern-Lands/) **Currently not available due to time and motivation issues.**  
  Primarily focused on bringing you a visual overhaul similar to Borderlands and other cell-shaded games and secondly focused on a player empowering progression and the addition of a huge amount of enchantments spread through the world of Skyrim.

- [Dishonored Plus](https://dishonored-plus.eziothedeadpoet.at/)  
  A small collection of essential mods for Dishonored that adds some QoL improvemnts.
